## Background

Dota 2 is a competitive multi-player online battle arena (MOBA) PC game developed by Valve Corporation. 

The MOBA gaming genre has grown exponentially in recent years – statistics show that Dota 2 currently averages approximately 700,000 concurrent players daily.

While most of these players are casual gamers, the highly strategic and teamwork orientated nature of Dota has spurred a vibrant, active E-Sport industry around the game – attracting teams of professional players and hoards of enthusiast spectators to participate in hundreds of tournaments worldwide.

## Objective

The objective of this proposed database is to store data and statistics from the budding professional Dota 2 scene. 

Primarily, the database aims to keep track of the professional teams, players, matches and tournaments. For a team, we wish to store its current registered players and the primary country which it represents. 

We also wish to store some basic data about the players of professional teams – such as their name and nationality. For each tournament, we wish to record the date of the tournament, its matches, participants and winning team. 

In any given tournament match – the database will store the match statistics as they stood at the end of the match. For example – individual player statistics, the date of the match, total kills by each teams and the match winner. 

In order to record the above information, we will also need to store data on the match’s heroes and items. Additionally, Dota fans want to follow what computer hardware their favourite pro players are using.

## Value

Relational information stored in this database could be used to generate and track meta data and statistics about Dota players, tournaments and teams. 

For example – we could utilize the data to maintain an automatic leaderboard of the most successful teams, see trending heroes or team compositions, aggregated match statistics, track favoured heroes or item combinations for a given player etc. 

This database would be of significant interest to fans and those with vested interests in the game's professional scene. 

A web front end to the database would allow users to easily search, generate and view player, team and match statistics.
